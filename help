This script was used to help fitting a large number of flow curves.

1. Input file format.
The main requirement is that the flow-curve files must be formatted in the following way:
1.1. An arbitrary number of comment lines
1.2. A line starting with a semicolon(;), before the data table.
     It must contain the column names, which must have both Eta and GP in them.
1.3. The data, separated by a semicolon(;)

An example of a valid file is:
;GP in 1/s;Tau in Pa;Eta in Pas;T in Â°C;t in s;t_seg in s;
1|1; ;0,06978; ; ;17,86;7,239;
1|2; ;0,09985; ; ;22,75;12,13;

Note, however, that GP and Eta are empty. 
This is because multiple experiments were ran at once, one after the other.
However, the program ignores these blank data points and only adds what is necessary.

Another example of a valid file:
1|1; ;0,06978; ; ;17,86;7,239;
1|2; ;0,09985; ; ;22,75;12,13;
		...
3|1;0,0009986;0,04055;40,61; ;245,4;33,01;
3|2;0,002151;0,07458;34,68; ;278,6;66,18;

Now, the columns contain the necessary data and fitting can continue.

2. Fitting methodology
The program can fit the data chosen by the user or automatically, the latter using one of two algorithms.

1. Minimizing the fitting error
2. Minimizing the fitting error divided by the number of points chosen.

The second one will choose, on average, more points, so the result if more representative, but the error might be larger.

3. Settings

#### General ####
INLINE_GRAPHS: Inline graphs is meant for those with IDEs like Spyder
PLOT_GRAPHS: Plot graphs after fitting, with error propagation? Slows down the process greatly.
SAVE_GRAPHS: Save graphs after fitting? Useless if PLOT_GRAPHS is set to False
TREAT_ALL: Treat all files in folder with the extension EXT
EXT: Extension of files to look for when batch treating

#### Linear Fitting ####
DO_LIN: Perform linear fit?
SORTING_METHOD_LIN: Sorting method of the automatic linear method. Can be 'by_error', minimizing the error, or 'by_error_length', which minimizes the error divided by the total number of points used. Valid entries: by_error, by_error_length
AUTO_LIN: Set to True if you want the linear fitting to be done automatically. False, if to be done manually.

#### Non-Linear Fitting ####
DO_NL: Perform non-linear fitting?
NL_FITTING_METHOD: Fitting method. 'Carreau', 'Cross', 'Carreau-Yasuda'
SORTING_METHOD_NL: Can be 'overall', minimizing the error of all parameters, or 'eta_0', minimizing the error of only this parameter. At this time, this feature is disabled.
AUTO_NL: Set to True if you want the non linear fitting to be done automatically

##### Debug #####
DEBUG: Show debug messages
