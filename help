This script was used to help fitting a large number of flow curves.

1. Input file format.
The main requirement is that the flow-curve files must be formatted in the following way:
1.1. An arbitrary number of comment lines
1.2. A line starting with a semicolon(;), before the data table.
     It must contain the column names, which must have both Eta and GP in them.
1.3. The data, separated by a semicolon(;)

An example of a valid file is:
;GP in 1/s;Tau in Pa;Eta in Pas;T in Â°C;t in s;t_seg in s;
1|1; ;0,06978; ; ;17,86;7,239;
1|2; ;0,09985; ; ;22,75;12,13;

Note, however, that GP and Eta are empty. 
This is because multiple experiments were ran at once, one after the other.
However, the program ignores these blank data points and only adds what is necessary.

Another example of a valid file:
1|1; ;0,06978; ; ;17,86;7,239;
1|2; ;0,09985; ; ;22,75;12,13;
		...
3|1;0,0009986;0,04055;40,61; ;245,4;33,01;
3|2;0,002151;0,07458;34,68; ;278,6;66,18;

Now, the columns contain the necessary data and fitting can continue.

2. Fitting methodology
The program can fit the data chosen by the user or automatically, the latter using one of two algorithms.

1. Minimizing the fitting error
2. Minimizing the fitting error divided by the number of points chosen.

The second one will choose, on average, more points, so the result if more representative, but the error might be larger.

3. Settings

DEBUG: Set this to True to activate the debug messages in the program.
SPYDER: Set this to True to assume there is inline representation of graphs, not separate windows.
SORTING: Set this to either either 'by_error' or 'by_error_length', including the '', to select between the two automatic fitting methods.
