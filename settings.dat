#This is an automatically created settings file.

# Inline graphs is meant for those with IDEs like Jupyter Notebooks
INLINE_GRAPHS=False
# Plot graphs after fitting, with error propagation? Slows down the process greatly.
PLOT_GRAPHS=True
# Save graphs after fitting? Useless if PLOT_GRAPHS is set to False
SAVE_GRAPHS=False
# When plotting, time it waits until the next plot is shown, in seconds
WAIT=5
# Treat all files in folder?
TREAT_ALL=True
# Extension of files to look for
EXT=csv
# If the important data has been extracted
PREV_EXTRACTED=True

#### Linear Fitting ####
# Perform linear fit?
DO_LIN=True
# Sorting method of the automatic linear method.
# Can be 'by_error', minimizing the error, 'by_error_length', which minimizes the error divided by the total number of points used, 'by_R2', which minimizes R squared.
LIN_SORTING_METHOD=by_error_length
# Set to True if you want the linear fitting to be done automatically. False, if to be done manually.
AUTO_LIN=True

#### Non-Linear Fitting ####
# Perform non-linear fitting?
DO_NL=True
# Fitting method. 'Carreau', 'Cross', 'Carreau-Yasuda'
NL_FITTING_METHOD=Carreau
# Can be 'overall', minimizing the error of all parameters,  'eta_0', minimizing the error of only this parameter, or 'R2'.
NL_SORTING_METHOD=R2
# Set to True if you want the non linear fitting to be done automatically
AUTO_NL=True
# Set to true if the first point should be fixed during fitting
FIXED_FP_NL=False
# If FIXED_FP_NL is true, how much can it travel? This must be in terms of theinverse of the length, that is, length/MAX_FP_NL. 1 would be the entire curve (notrecommended. 2 would be up to half the curve, etc.
MAX_FP_NL=3
