# Inline graphs is meant for those with IDEs like Jupyter Notebooks

# Plot graphs after fitting, with error propagation? Slows down the process greatly.

#### Linear Fitting ####
# Perform linear fit?
DO_LIN=True
# Sorting method of the automatic linear method.
# Can be 'by_error', minimizing the error, or 'by_error_length', which minimizes the error divided by the total number of points used.
LIN_SORTING_METHOD=by_error
# Set to True if you want the linear fitting to be done automatically. False, if to be done manually.
AUTO_LIN=True

#### Non-Linear Fitting ####
# Perform non-linear fitting?
DO_NL=True
# Fitting method. 'Carreau', 'Cross', 'Carreau-Yasuda'
NL_FITTING_METHOD=Carreau
# Can be 'overall', minimizing the error of all parameters, or 'eta_0', minimizing the error of only this parameter.
NL_SORTING_METHOD=overall
# Set to True if you want the non linear fitting to be done automatically
AUTO_NL=True

##### Debug #####
